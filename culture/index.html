    <h2>Religion</h2><p class="body">The three main religions in Baghdad were Islam, Judaism and Christianity, who lived in the northern part of Baghdad, north of of Sūḳ al-G̲h̲azl, and west of of Sūḳ al-G̲h̲azl respectively. Among the three, Arabic was the common language spoken. Most of the Persians lived on the west side. Of these religions, Islam seemed to be a religion of the elite more than the other 2 (cerca ~900's CE). <a href="https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=6J0WnWABM34C&oi=fnd&pg=PR11&dq=medieval+baghdad+islam&ots=u2-3QL80I0&sig=i9SrPaaxpZOkNGTaVQpNcSzpxMg#v=onepage&q=religion&f=false">[1]</a> The Mosque, or main center of worship was also a very important building during this time. In addition to being the main center of worship, it was also the head of religious and political life.<!-- Christianity had monks !--></p>
    <h2>Art</h2><p class="body">A lot of art was made and sold in Baghdad, and along with most other trade items, they were sold at the Bazaar. One of these items is Bowl depicting a Man holding a Cup and a Flowering Branch (image below). This is an example of a piece of art that would be bought and sold in the Bazaar, as well as other marketplaces.</p>
