        <p class="body">Baghdad was established in 8th century and was an economic center until its fall in about 1200 AD. 
            Baghdad was established because the Abbasids wanted a new capital, and to increase their <i>dawla</i>, or amount of land. 
            Al-Saffāḥ tried the cities of Hās̲h̲imiyya and Al-Manṣūr, however both were vulnerable to attackers and were too distracting to his army. 
            He was looking for a new city, and wanted it to succeed Babylon and all the other big cities at that time. He chose the site of Baghdad because 
            it had a fertile plain, and was near a river and on the Kudasan road. It had a good temperature and not a major mosquito problem. </p>
            <p class="body">Baghdad is also the home of the Green dome, in the center of the round city, even featuring a horseman on the top of it. See <a href="" for more info.
